    <h1>Sand Generator</h1>
    <div id="canvas-container"></div>

    <p>To accompany my Gold CREST Project on Generative Algorithms I have developed this program that randomly generates sand to create different patterns and art.</p>
    
    <p>The purpose of creating this program was to learn how to create an interesting Generative Algorithm using but also have that GA do something. Using p5.js enabled me to visualise my program so I could explore randomness and probability.</p>
